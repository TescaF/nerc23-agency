Alex Wong is an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Yale University. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from UCLA in 2019 and was co-advised by Stefano Soatto and Alan Yuille. He was previously a post-doctoral research scholar at UCLA under the guidance of Stefano Soatto. His research lies in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics and largely focuses on multi-sensor fusion for 3D reconstruction, robust vision under adverse conditions, unsupervised learning, and medical image analysis. His work has received the outstanding student paper award at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2011 and the best paper award in robot vision at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019.
